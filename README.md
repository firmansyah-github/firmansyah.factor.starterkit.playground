# Firmansyah Factor Starter-kit Playground

"Welcome to the Firmansyah Factor Starter-kit Playground GitHub repository. This repository is designed for learning and experimenting with the following components:

1. **Factor FreeMarker Mindmap and Xmind Software Tool:**
   - To facilitate a swift understanding of Apache FreeMarker 2.3.26, which serves as our template engine, we have provided a detailed mind map. You can find more information in this [link](./factor.freemarker.xmind/README.md).

2. **Factor Eclipse IDE Snippets XML Files:**
   - These files are essential for storing and managing code snippets or templates that can be easily incorporated into your FreeMarker template source code. These snippets can encompass commonly used code fragments or templates for recurring code patterns. They streamline your development workflow by enabling you to quickly insert boilerplate code or common constructs without manual typing. You can find additional details in this [link](./factor.eclipse.snippets/README.md).

3. **Factor FreeMarker Template Examples:**
   - This collection comprises template files that can be modified and tested for rendering using the Factor Eclipse Plugin. These template examples also offer guidance on utilizing the "Content Assist of The Factor FreeMarker" for efficient template development. Note that Content Assist functions optimally when the template is opened through the Factor Eclipse Plugin. Further details can be found in this [link](./factor.templates.example/README.md).

## Prerequisites:
To make the most of this resource, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

## How to get Eclipse IDE
You can download and install the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE) by following these steps:

1. **Visit the Eclipse Website**:
   Go to the official Eclipse website at [https://www.eclipse.org/](https://www.eclipse.org/).

2. **Choose Your Eclipse IDE Flavor**:
   Eclipse offers different IDE flavors tailored for various programming languages and development needs. The most common ones are Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers, Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers, Eclipse IDE for PHP Developers, and more. Choose the one that best suits your development requirements.

3. **Download Eclipse**:
   Click on the download link for the Eclipse IDE flavor you've selected. You will be redirected to a download page.

4. **Select Your Download**:
   On the download page, you will often find different download options, such as different versions of Eclipse IDE and download mirrors. Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS) and click on the download link. Be sure to select the version that matches your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).

5. **Download the Installer**:
   Eclipse now offers an installer, which simplifies the installation process. You can choose to download the installer (recommended) or download the package as a zip file. The installer provides a user-friendly way to manage Eclipse installations and plugins.

6. **Run the Installer or Extract the Zip File**:
   If you downloaded the installer, run it, and it will guide you through the installation process. If you downloaded the zip file, extract its contents to a directory of your choice.

7. **Launch Eclipse**:
   Once the installation is complete or the zip file is extracted, you can launch Eclipse by running the `eclipse` executable file located in the Eclipse directory.

8. **Workspace Selection**:
   When you first run Eclipse, it will ask you to select a workspace directory. This is where your projects and configuration settings will be stored. You can choose the default workspace or specify a different location.

9. **Start Developing**:
   You are now ready to start using Eclipse for your development projects. You can create new projects, import existing ones, and install additional plugins to enhance your development environment.

Eclipse is a highly extensible IDE, so you can customize it with various plugins and extensions to support different programming languages and development tasks. Additionally, you can check for updates and manage plugins via the Eclipse Marketplace, which is accessible from the Eclipse IDE itself.

Remember to ensure that you have Java installed on your system, as Eclipse is a Java-based application, and it requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or a Java Development Kit (JDK) to run.
