====================================================================================================================================
A. Many Generation Type Logic Rule
====================================================================================================================================
1. Applicable only to files and not folders.
2. Folders will always undergo the copy operation.
3. File Name Handling:
   a. Remove the '.ftl' file extension if it is present at the end of the file name. For example, "Person.java.ftl" will become "Person.java."
   b. File names may contain placeholders, such as "[phType]Model.java.ftl" or "Domain[phType]DTO.java.ftl." The available options for "[phType]" are:
      - "[table]"  : to be replaced by the table name
      - "[base]"   : to be replaced by the base name
      - "[class]"  : to be replaced by the class name
      - "[instance]": to be replaced by the instance name
4. Applicable Private System Attributes for Files:
   a. PRV_SYS_GEN_TYPE: 
      A private system placeholder to define generation type options (one, many, copy). Used 'many' for this case.
      If not provided, the default generation type used is 'copy.'
      
   b. PRV_SYS_GEN_PATH:
      A private system placeholder to define the generated relative path relative to the Root Directory Deployment as the base path. 
      If not provided, no custom path is created; it is rendered on the Root Directory Deployment. 
      Directories are automatically created based on the defined values.
      - "[table]"  : replaced by the table name
      - "[base]"   : replaced by the base name
      - "[class]"  : replaced by the class name
      - "[instance]": replaced by the instance name
      Example : "many-path/main/java/[class]/[table]/[instance]/test/[base]"
      
   c. PRV_SYS_GEN_FILENAME:
      A private system placeholder to define the file name that needs to be generated. 
      If a custom file name is required, it should be specified. 
      The '.ftl' file extension is removed if it exists at the end of the file name. If not provided, the file name remains as is.
      
   d. PRV_SYS_IS_REPLACE:
      A private system placeholder to determine whether to replace the file (true or false). 
      If set to 'false,' an additional suffix is added to the file name. 
      If not provided, the default value is 'false.'
      
   e. PRV_SYS_JAVA_PACKAGE:
      A private system placeholder to define the package name and automatically create directories based on the defined values. 
      For example: "id.co.factor.[table].[base].[class].[instance]"
      - "[table]"  : replaced by the table name
      - "[base]"   : replaced by the base name
      - "[class]"  : replaced by the class name
      - "[instance]": replaced by the instance name
5. All Factor FreeMarker Directives, Predefined Subroutines, User-Defined Subroutines, Public and Private System Attributes, Public Attributes, and Private (File) Attributes will have their values replaced, rendered, and changed.
6. The full path of the gnerated file is created according to the following pattern:
   [Root Directory Deployment] + [PRV_SYS_GEN_PATH] + [PRV_SYS_JAVA_PACKAGE] + [PRV_SYS_GEN_FILENAME]
   Ensure the path combination between PRV_SYS_GEN_PATH and PRV_SYS_JAVA_PACKAGE is correctly configured.
