# Apache FreeMarker 2.3.26 Learning Starter Kit
Apache FreeMarker is an open-source, Java-based template engine that enables developers to separate the presentation layer from the application logic. It is primarily utilized for the generation of dynamic content, including HTML, XML, and various other text-based formats, through the processing of templates with data.

The Factor (Firmansyah Advanced CRUD Generator) Eclipse Plugin employs Apache FreeMarker 2.3.26 as its engine for processing templates, data, and placeholders to generate dynamic content in formats such as HTML, XML, and others.

Familiarizing yourself with Apache FreeMarker 2.3.26 is essential for creating templates effectively. We have prepared an "Apache FreeMarker.xmind" file for your convenience, which you can open using Xmind.

Below, you'll find screenshots from within the "Apache FreeMarker.xmind" file:
