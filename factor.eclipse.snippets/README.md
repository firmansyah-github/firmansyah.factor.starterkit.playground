# Eclipse Snippets - The Factor (Firmansyah Advanced CRUD Generator) - Apache FreeMarker

In the context of the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE), "snippets" typically refer to code snippets. 
Eclipse snippets are concise, reusable code fragments that can be swiftly incorporated into your source code files. 
Their purpose is to streamline coding tasks, enhance productivity, and promote code consistency, 
which is particularly valuable for designing The Factor Templates.


# Snippets XML Files and Descriptions

Within this The Factor Eclipse Snippets Apache FreeMarker starter kit, we offer a selection of snippets in XML format that you can seamlessly import into your Eclipse environment.

# Importing Snippet XML Files into Eclipse

In Eclipse, you can easily import snippet XML files to streamline your coding tasks. Here's how to do it:

1. **Open Eclipse**: Launch your Eclipse IDE if it's not already open.

2. **Access the Snippets View**:
   - Go to the "Window" menu.
   - Select "Show View" and then "Other..."
   - In the "Show View" dialog, expand the "General" category.
   - Select "Snippets" and click "OK." This will open the Snippets view in Eclipse.

3. **Import Snippets**:
   - In the Snippets view, locate the "Import Snippets" icon in the toolbar. This icon typically resembles an arrow pointing into a box or folder.
   - Hover over the icon to see its tooltip, which should confirm that it's the import function.

4. **Select the XML File**:
   - Click the "Import Snippets" icon to open the file selection dialog.
   - Navigate your file system to find and select the XML file containing the snippets you want to import.
   - Confirm your selection by clicking "Open" or "OK."

5. **Review Imported Snippets**:
   - Once you've imported the XML file, you'll see the snippets it contains displayed in the Snippets view.

6. **Use Imported Snippets**:
   - To use an imported snippet, simply drag and drop it from the Snippets view into your source code file (FreeMarker template file) at the location where you want to insert it.

Please note that the specific steps may vary slightly depending on the version of Eclipse you're using, but the general process for importing snippets from XML files remains consistent across Eclipse IDE versions that support snippets.
